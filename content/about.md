The name's `Sarvagya Sagar` . He is a tireless seeker of knowledge, occassional purveyor of wisdom and also, coincidentally, a hacker. He enjoys never being satisfied with his programming, traveling, bhojpuri songs & movies, teaching, burger, mathematics and occasionally sketching with touch of mellow smoothness. Stab forks into your eyeballs looking at his [`Twitter`](https://twitter.com/0xdotexe "Disturb me on Twitter") handler to take a closer look at his work history and whatnot. Technology should work for people, not the other way around.

- In high school, I was a kid in diaper that seemed to never be paying attention. Seemingly in my own world of comics, zine and my small tablet toy. I’ve had a pencil in my hand since I was in diapers. Things never change I’m no longer in diapers though.

- When I started college, My parents gifted me a computer. After playing games for a year or so, I thought if games could be developed then it can be hacked too :) I Originally had the idea to hack games with the help of CheatEngine and reverse engineering. I started watching videos "How to hack games, How to use CheatEngine, Reversing Windows Games" . That was my first step and effort into hacking, After that, I was too much passionate about Information Security & Spend most of my time in learning security. I learned a lot from Twitter - Infosec Community Specially : *"Zseano, Somdev, Sector035, Tomnomnom, Samy Kamkar, Peter Yaworski, Zephrfish, Stok, m4v3r1k, nahamsec, Liveoverflow, Edoverflow, MalwareTech, phwd, g0tm1lk, Pinkpanther, Portswigger Community, Julia evans and rest all."*  

- I love (OS/GEO/SOCM)INT, I love to play with Regex or Regular Expression. I do the hacking I do because I love it. I like the people I meet. I embrace the nerd and I'm fan of Samy Kamkar, Elon Musk and Eliot Higins. Hopefully we cross paths in the real world someday and we can make it a better place together. At last I'm just a kid who never hear about `"Haxoring"`.
